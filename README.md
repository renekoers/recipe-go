## Recipe & Go

A website to make shopping for products to make a recipe, more convenient.

### How to install the web application

First of all, run `npm install` inside of the `/recipe-go/` folder and 
the `/recipe-go/client` server. 
Afterwards, a RavenDB database needs to be setup on the following URL: `http://localhost:1337/`
and it needs the name of: `RecipeGo`

### Running the web application

All that then needs to be done is running `npm run server` in `/recipe-go/` to let make npm run the backend server,
followed by another terminal running `npm run build` in `/recipe-go/` to run the frontend react server
